Go through the README to determine how to apply for an event badge at https://github.com/badging/diversity-and-inclusion/

1. The goal is to open a “draft” Pull Request against master following the outlined process — feel free to creatively mock it like it is for a real event.

   > **Hint** — This PR process emphasizes visibility and traceability by:
   >
   > - Appending a single row into the README.md
   > - Retaining all application details and threads in a single op

2. It helps to keep track of the steps you took in a secret gist, just the over all, nothing to detailed which can be found in the draft PR.

   > **Hint** — Keeping notes in secret gists makes it possible to:
   >
   > - Keep `markdown` and other files together
   > - Make revisions to them just like a repository
   > - Share it with others using the secret link

3. Place a link to this secret gist in a comment below. Please feel free to also keep notes on inconsistencies or things you felt could be improved — constructive feedback is a vital component of open collaboration.

   > **Hint** — Collaboration comes in many forms, including:
   >
   > - Outlining friction
   > - Analyzing problem(s)
   > - Offering solution(s)

4. Once you are done with the PR, place a link to to it in a comment below.
